 GRT Derivative Example
 This example demonstrates how to create and use the GRT Derivative PreProcessing Module.
 
 The Derivative module computes either the first or second order derivative of the input signal. 
 
 In this example we create two Derivative instances, one to compute the first derivative of the
 input signal and another to compute the second derivative of a 1-dimensional input signal.
 
 We then create a sine-wave signal as the input signal to both Derivative instances, the sine signal
 and first and second derivative signals are then saved to a file (so you can plot the results in 
 Matlab, Excel, etc. if needed).
 
 This example shows you how to:
 - Create a new Derivative instance to compute either the first or second derivative
 - Compute the (1st and 2nd) derivative of a sine-wave signal
 - Save the Derivative settings to a file
 - Load the Derivative settings from a file
