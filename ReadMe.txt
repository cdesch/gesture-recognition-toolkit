Version: 0.1

Thanks for downloading the GRT, this is a quick guide to help you get started.  You can find a wide 
range of resources on the main GRT website:

------------------------------------------------
Overview
------------------------------------------------
The Gesture Recognition Toolkit (GRT) is a cross-platform, open-source, c++ machine learning library 
that has been specifically designed for real-time gesture recognition.

------------------------------------------------
Installing and using the GRT in your c++ projects
------------------------------------------------
To use the GRT you simply need to add all of the code contained in the GRT folder to your c++ project.  
If you are using an IDE such as XCode or VisualStudio then you can either add the files in the GRT 
folder to your project using "File -> Add Files to project", or in most IDEs you can simply drag the 
GRT folder (from Finder or Windows Explorer) into your IDE which should add all of the files in the GRT 
folder to your project.

After you have added the code in the GRT folder to your project, you can now use any of the GRT 
functions or classes by adding the following two lines of code to the top of any header file in your 
project in which you want to use the GRT code:

#include "GRT/GRT.h"
using namespace GRT;

The first line of code above adds the main GRT header file (GRT.h) to your project, this header file 
contains all of the GRT module header files which means you do not need to manually include any other 
GRT header files.  The second line of code states that you are using the GRT namespace, this means
that you don't have to write GRT::WhatEverClass every time you want to use a GRT class and can instead
simply write WhatEverClass.

Note that, depending on your IDE, you may have to specify the physical path that 
you placed the GRT folder in on your hard drive, for instance you might have to write something like:

#include "/Users/Nick/Documents/Dev/cpp/gesture-recognition-toolkit/GRT/GRT.h"

Tutorials and Examples
------------------------------------------------
You can find a large number of tutorials and examples in the GRTExamples folder.  You can also find a
wide range of examples and references on the main GRT wiki:
